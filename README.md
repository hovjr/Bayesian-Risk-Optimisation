# Bayesian-Risk-Optimisation
This thesis explores a risk-driven approach to optimizing clinical trial portfolios through Bayesian optimization. It addresses the challenges faced by pharmaceutical companies in managing uncertainty during drug development, particularly in clinical trials, which are resource-intensive and prone to failure. By adopting a Bayesian framework, this work enables dynamic updates to trial designs as new data becomes available, allowing for early decision-making and more efficient resource allocation. The thesis integrates advanced statistical methods and Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to compute optimal strategies, minimizing recruited patients and costs while maximizing the overall utility of the portfolio. Through simulated data, the research demonstrates how these methods can guide better decision-making in clinical programme portfolios, balancing risk and reward for pharmaceutical sponsors.
